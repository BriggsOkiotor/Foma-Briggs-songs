### Ep Background

The “testing the microphone” half of an album (EP) should be my first ever lyrical body of work. Lyrically expressing my struggles and setbacks as a result of 
Parental Misguidiance Lovefully.

Being just a bathroom performing artist for a long time and how I toggled thru decision making of being a career person & a #bathroomartist to become a recording and performing Afro beats artist.

As an individual who has suffered untold struggles  that has majorly brought about delay, some level of #Grace is needed to catch up with all of the wasted time, because grace they say is an unmerited favor that checkmates labor and set you apart restoring time. 
Accompanied in this Ep project is my first ever recorded studio song project

The EP opens with "Olopa," a powerful and commemorative song about the tragic events of October 20, 2020. This track is a solemn tribute to the Nigerian youth who lost their lives at the Lekki Toll Gate. They were peaceful protesters, advocating for an end to police brutality (referred to as "olopa") and demanding good governance. Shot without warning or official acknowledgment, even as they held the national flag, their deaths sent shockwaves through the country. This song is a reminder of the devastating impact of that day, which paralyzed Nigeria's economy for weeks and severely damaged the government's global reputation.

"Olopa" is a steadfast call to action, urging people to never stop speaking up and to keep the memory of October 20, 2020, alive. It underscores the belief that true power resides with the people, especially the youth, and serves as a powerful warning that power, if mismanaged, can ultimately be the downfall of those who hold it.

The EP's narrative also shows a different sides of expression.

"#wotowoto" A vibrant and celebratory track that serves as a vocal flex. It's a fun, high-energy song that confidently expresses and confirms sexual my stamina.

"#Dancewithme" A testament to my musical talent and creative vision. The song is a declaration of confidence in his ability to create music so compelling that it can get anyone, anywhere, to dance.

The EP concludes with "#Shege," a hard-hitting amapiano track. This song speaks to the untold challenges, pain, faced. Yet, despite all the setbacks and negativity, "#Shege" is about choosing to party and celebrate life regardless of the hardship. It's an anthem of resilience and a refusal to be broken and remain downcasted.
